For the High Altitude Balloon Project [HAB](https://melbourne-rpi.com.au/hab/) I am involved with, it was decided the we need some practice tracking and retrieving payloads from balloons that visited the stratosphere by chasing down some weather balloons.

Inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBy-bXEWZeM) about using SDRs to track down weather balloon and then reprogramming them.
