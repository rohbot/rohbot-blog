* Disclaimer - This is not the only way to flash the [RS41HUP](https://github.com/darksidelemm/RS41HUP) firmware to a RS41 but this is what worked for me

## 1. Catch a Sonde
Go out and track down a Radiosonde that's been launched by the BOM. It might be helpful to check out [auto_rx](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx) project
## 1. Crack it open
Using a small flat head screw driver, lever it under the front clip until it pops off
